Good job! I hope you now understand the task, and are ready for the real experiment.

We are recording your EEG. Try to sit still and not blink too much. If possible, try to blink in between trials, and not during the delay (when you are memorizing a color for a search task).

Also, try to fixate to the middle of the screen. During search, you can make small eye movements.

Now is the time to ask the experimenter if things are still not clear.

Otherwise, you can start.

You will do NBLOCKS blocks of NTRIALS trials. Each block takes approx. 5-6 minutes, and the whole experiment one hour.

You will not receive feedback after each button press, but after each block your average performance is summarized on the screen.

During the breaks in between blocks, you can move a little. If you get sleepy, try to regain your attention to the task during these breaks.

Are you ready?

Press the spacebar!
