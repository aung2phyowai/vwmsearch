If the task is still unclear, you can now ask the experimenter.

During the experiment, always try to fixate to the middle of the screen (to the white dot). Try to respond as fast as possible, but also try to be accurate. 

You will now practice for NTRIALS trials.

You will receive feedback every time you respond.
