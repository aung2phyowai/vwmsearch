Welcome to this experiment.

On each trial you will first briefly see two colored circles. 

One has a grey line around it: you can ignore this one (the distractor).
The other has a black line around it: you need to remember this one (the target).

After a short delay, you need to search for the target among other distractor colors.

The black line around the the target can be solid, or dashed.

When the black line is dashed, the search task will be easy.
When the black line is solid, the search task will be difficult.

In the search display, press the button that corresponds to the orientation of the clockwheel in the target:

Top-left: F
Bottom-left: V
Top-right: J
Bottom-right: N

This may sound difficult. Press the spacebar to see an example trial.
