Sometimes, there will not be a test stimulus, but instead
the fixation dot will get a small circle around it.

This indicates that you have to manually reproduce the duration
of the memory delay (in other words: how long you were remembering
the orientation stimulus).

Press the space bar to start reproducing the delay. The fixation
dot will turn red. When you think a delay of similar duration
has ended, press the space bar again, and the fixation dot
will turn white again, and the next trial will start.

Press a button to see an example trial.
