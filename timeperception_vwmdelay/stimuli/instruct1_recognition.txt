Welcome to this experiment.

On each trial you will first briefly see a stimulus
consisting of lines in a particular orientation.

You need to remember this picture during a delay. 

After this delay you will see another orientation-stimulus.

Your task is to judge whether this orientation is similar
to the one you remembered.

If it is the same, press F.
If it is different, press J.

Try to respond as fast but also as accurate as possible.
