Welcome to this experiment.

On each trial you will first briefly see a stimulus
consisting of lines in a particular orientation.

You need to remember this picture during a delay. 

After this delay you will see 6 similar stimuli in 
an array. 
Your task is to find the remembered orientation, and
report on which side of the screen it is located.

If you found it on the left side, press F.
If you found it on the right side, press J.

Try to respond as fast but also as accurate as possible.
