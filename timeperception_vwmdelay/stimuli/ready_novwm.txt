In the next NBLOCKS blocks of NTRIALS trials,
locate where there are two of the same orientations
in the search array.

On random trials, reproduce the delay between the
irrelevant orientation stimulus and the search array.

You will only receive feedback about your average
performance after each block.

If you press a button, the actual experiment will start.
