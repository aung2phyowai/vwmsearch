Welcome to this experiment.

On each trial you will first briefly see a stimulus
consisting of vertical lines. This stimulus is irrelevant,
you ignore and forget it. 

After a certain delay you will see 6 similar stimuli in 
an array. 

Your task is to judge on which side of the screen you see
two identical orientations.

If you found them on the left side, press F.
If you found them on the right side, press J.

Try to respond as fast but also as accurate as possible.
